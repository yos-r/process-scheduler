i modified the functions that find the .so files and that load the functions within
1- the directory from which to look for .so files has been changed to     
    const char *directory = "/usr/local/lib/algos";
        presuming that .so files have been built and have been placed in usr/local/lib in the make and run process
2- load scheduling algorithm looks for function names from the files in usr/local/lib
    snprintf(fullPath, sizeof(fullPath), "/usr/local/lib/algos/%s", algorithmName);
    

for GTK: 
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-0
    // development library
    sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev

    sudo apt-get install pkg-config
